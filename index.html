            <h1>Dogs: Our best friends in sickness and in health</h1>
            <hr>
        </header>
        <p>Dogs, often hailed as humans' best friends, have been the topic of many scientific studies looking into how
            they might boost our well-being. In this Spotlight, we'll explain how your friendly pup can benefit your
            health across the board.
        </p>
        <div class="picture"><img src="./DF38A6F7-1167-43A4-99F9-D5425598C846-37666-00000421715CA90E.jpg" alt="Picture of the happy dog"
            title="Dogs make us happy"></div>

        <p>According to the <abbr title='American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals'>ASPCA</abbr>, an
            estimated dogs are owned as pets in the United States.
            It is likely that humans and dogs have shared a special bond of friendship and mutual support ever since at
            least the Neolithic period — but why has this bond been so long-lasting? <br>
            Of course, these cousins of the wolves have historically been great at keeping us and our dwellings safe,
            guarding our houses, our cattle, and our various material goods. Throughout history, humans have also
            trained dogs to assist them with hunting, or they have bred numerous quirky-looking species for their
            cuteness or elegance. <br>
            However, dogs are also — and might have always been — truly valued companions, famed for their loyalty and
            seemingly constant willingness to put a smile on their owners' faces.</p>

        <h2>How dogs keep you in good health</h2>
        <p>
            The study that showed that owning a dog reduces a person's risk of premature death by up to a third and
            suggest that dog owners have a lower risk of heart disease. <br>

            The most prominent such lifestyle factor is physical activity. There is no way around it: if you own a dog,
            you have to commit to twice daily walks — and sometimes even more. <br>
            Moreover, several recent studies — including <a
                href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/309358.php" target="_blank">one</a> from the University of Missouri in
            Columbia
            and <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317842.php" target="_blank">another</a> from Glasgow Caledonian
            University in the United Kingdom — found that adults aged 60 and over
            enjoy better health thanks to the “enforced” exercise they get by walking their dogs.

        <blockquote>
            "Over the course of a week, this additional time spent walking may in itself be sufficient to meet [World
            Health Organization] recommendations of at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity."
            - <span class="author">Philippa Dall, Glasgow Caledonian University</span>
        </blockquote>

        <b>Also, children exposed to certain bacteria carried by dogs also experienced a reduction of asthma symptoms,
            the researchers noted.</b>

        <h2>Dogs make people feel good</h2>
        <p>

            Perhaps the most intuitive benefit of sharing your life and home with a canine friend is that dogs give you
            “feel-good vibes” almost instantly.
            This, researchers explain, is due to the effect of the “love hormone” oxytocin. <br>

            <q>During the last decades</q>, write the authors of a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00234/full" target="_blank">review</a> that featured in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em>, <q>animal
                assistance in therapy, education, and care has greatly increased</q>.
